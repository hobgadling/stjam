- "Who's the changeling?" -- (LA)RPG/Cards -- as changeling, your objective is to create as much destruction as possible. Other characters have various objectives they can earn points for. Other characters may also have destructive objectives or embarasssing secrets. Unmasking the wrong person as changeling causes the changeling to win. Unmasking the correct person as changeling is like catching the Snitch in quidditch: it forces everyone to count up their points, and the winner wins. Definitely want some degree of randomness with the characters, setting, and objectives. It would also be interesting to have the characters write some of their own objectives at the start of the game. 
      I'm picturing that there are something like 50 character cards, 50 objective cards, 1 "you are the changeling" joker card with the same back as the objective cards, 20 place setting cards, 20 event cards (things like "scientific conference", "diplomatic function", "subspace anomaly", etc, that cause the characters to come together). At the start of the game, the dealer draws a random place setting and event that is announced to everyone. Everyone announces their (apparent) identies. The characters then come up with a basic storyline for why the subspace anomaly or whatever brought the 2 Romulans, 4 humans, and 1 Klingon together.
      The dealer then draws n-1 random objective cards and shuffles in the joker/changeling to that set, and passes those out. Players then each draw 2 other random objective cards. Of their 3 objective cards, players must use at least 2 objectives, and then they can write in a third objective. The person who got "changeling" has to be changeling, so if they want, they can make up their other two objectives. Objectives are things like "get a member of a different species to reveal military information - 5 pts unclassified, 10 point classified/strategic", "get a member of a belligerent race with a head crest (e.g. Klingon, Romulan, etc) to admit that they like something cute - 10 pts if it is also furry", "get a Federation member to lose his temper about something trivial - 10 pts if it's hilarious", "play cupid with 2 other players - 5 pts platonic, 10 pts if they are totes in love". When everyone's done writing their (secret) objectives, THE GAME BEGINS.
